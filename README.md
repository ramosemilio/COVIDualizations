# COVIDualizations
Python scripts for generating visualizations using JHU's COVID-19 collated data.


Data must be first downloaded from JHU https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data,
then checked for formatting errors using CSV_TOTAL_CASE_CHECKER.py for total case data or CSV_CHECKER.py for death data.

COVID_VIZ_03 is deprecated
CSV_PROCESS are to be run from inside of Autodesk Maya to generate the visualization

DEM, GEO, LAT, and NUKE scripts are WIP and use NASA/USGS files to texture a sphere with global elevaton data.
